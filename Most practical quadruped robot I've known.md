# Most practical quadruped robot I've known
![Swiss-Mile Quadruped Robot](../static/swissQuadruped.jpg)

These days there are many different types of quadruped robots from different companies and universities. It seems that gradually they will find their place in commercial sector. But I personally had some problems with them. I thought they aren't practical enough for real use cases. Despite fantastic progresses by Boston Dynamics and a few others, their agility and speed were limited and the use cases that they had a real advantage over other kinds of robots were very limited.
About two years ago, I saw a robot concept from Hyundai that depicted a wheeled quadruped robot that had both advantages of a wheeled and a quadruped robot. In my opinion that idea could totally change the game. (Off course this was my turn. Probably this idea has more literature.)

After that, the quadruped concept became more serious to me. Since then, videos of wheeled quadruped robots have been published in robotic societies from time to time. But in terms of type of movement and ability, they still did not look interesting. This time, I think the video released by the [Swiss-Mile](https://www.swiss-mile.com/) shows that the concept of a four-legged robot that is capable everywhere and has advantages over its rivals, is very close to reality. Below you can see this video.

The second video shows a little about how this robot moves from trajectory optimization to online predictive control.

I think one big step would be a car-size or even larger robot with this ability. It can be used in many cases like very rough roads or even mountains.Or in case of disasters it can help a lot.
