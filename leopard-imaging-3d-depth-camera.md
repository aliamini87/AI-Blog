Leopard Imaging in collaboration with NVIDIA is delivering cost-effective 3D stereo imaging solutions that provide real-time, accurate depth perception, giving developers the high-quality results needed to build and deploy edge AI and robotics applications.

The Hawk Camera offers a wide horizontal field of view of 120 and integrates dual OnSemi AR0234CS RGB image sensors with an active-pixel array of 1920 (H) x 1200(V) to support full HD video up to 120 fps. The dual performance in any high-vibration environments that the robot may encounter. This is coupled with a 6-axis IMU for highly accurate (sub-microsecond) timestamping of the camera frames relative to the IMU which is needed for high-precision robotics perception.

Leopard Imaging, an Elite Partner in the NVIDIA Jetson ecosystem, enhances the imaging quality with active alignment (AA) technolgy through its powerful manufacturing capabilities. Leopard Imaging’s full integration services will help customers incorporate the HAWK Camera into a full range of robotics projects and deployments.
